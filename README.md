## What is The Graide Network?

[The Graide Network](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/) connects K-12 teachers with qualified teaching assistants to grade and provide feedback on student work online. Feedback is one of the most powerful instructional tools that teachers have, so we help them give them more of it to their students.

## Our Story

The Graide Network was founded in 2015 by [Blair Pircon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blairmpircon/) and [Elizabeth Nell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enell/), and has [won numerous awards](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/awards-recognitions/) for being a promising and impactful education technology company.

Currently, the team comprises 9 full-time members. We work with teachers at over 100 schools across the country and employ several hundred college students as part-time grading assistants.

## About Engineering at The Graide Network

### Our impact

Technology is what allowed us to triple graded assignment volume without hiring more full time staff in 2017 and then we did it again in 2019. Technology continues to help us improve the speed, accuracy, and quality of our grading and feedback. The tools we build directly impact the grades that students receive on their papers, and they help teachers see how their class is doing in real-time. All this means that our software _has_ to work, and it has to be reliable, tested, and performant.

### Our stack

- **Frontend:** Typescript, Angular, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Redis, NGINX
