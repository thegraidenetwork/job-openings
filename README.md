## What is The Graide Network?

The Graide Network connects K-12 teachers with qualified teaching assistants to grade and provide feedback on student work online. Feedback is one of the most powerful instructional tools that teachers have, so we help them give them more of it.

## Who is on the team?

The Graide Network was founded in 2015 by [Blair Pircon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blairmpircon/) and [Elizabeth Nell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enell/), and has [won numerous awards](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/awards-recognitions/) for being a promising and impactful education technology company. In 2016, [Karl Hughes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karllhughes/) joined as the company's CTO, and in 2017, [Eileen Dominic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eileen-dominic-1b193346/) joined as our member success manager.

## About engineering at The Graide Network

### Our impact

Technology is what allowed us to triple graded assignment volume without hiring more full time staff in 2016, and technology continues to help us improve the speed, accuracy, and quality of our grading and feedback. The tools we build directly impact the grades that students receive on their papers, and they help teachers see how their class is doing in real-time. All this means that our software _has_ to work, and it has to be reliable, tested, and performant.

### Our stack

We are powered by a [suite of PHP microservices](https://blog.codeship.com/incremental-software-development-with-php-microservices/) written in the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/) and powered by MySQL databases. We're in the process of [sunsetting our Codeigniter frontend](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2016/9/12/modernizing-legacy-code-at-the-graide-network) in favor of a [single-page Javascript application using Angular 5](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2017/1/16/tech-accomplishments). We use Nginx as our web server and [Docker containers for virtualization](https://blog.codeship.com/building-a-php-command-line-app-with-docker/). Currently we're hosted on Microsoft's Azure platform thanks to their [BizSpark program](https://bizspark.microsoft.com/), but we also use various services like Bitbucket and Amazon S3 for code and file storage.

### Our team

The team is currently just me, [Karl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karllhughes/). I've been working as an engineer and engineering manager at early stage education technology companies (Uloop and Packback) in Chicago for the past 5 years. Some of my technical strengths include [automated testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcQryexNKhM), [microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8iqzB0za6A), [Docker](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/shiphp-book), and Laravel, but I'm pretty much a full-stack generalist.

We're looking to bring on two new team members in 2018. Could you be one of them? Check out the listings above for more info.
