## Job Description

As our second software engineer at The Graide Network you'll be involved with the whole development cycle. You will help plan the technical specifications and architecture of new features and updates, you will write high quality, testable code solo and with a pair, and you will help ensure that we capitalize on new technology opportunities. Learning is part of our DNA, so it's okay if you're not a technical expert at everything, but you should be ready to bring new ideas to the team and learn quickly.

While you will start out working mostly in our frontend code (Typescript/Angular 5), you'll also need to be okay with doing gradually more backend work over time (Laravel/PHP/MySQL). We do all our local dev in Docker containers, so you'll have to get familiar with that as well.

## Projects you will likely work on

We're a startup, so things change pretty often, but we've got a long list of interesting projects that our engineering team will be tackling in the coming year. Here are a few of them:

- Automated [grade norming](http://oldwriting.byu.edu/media/documents/org/65.pdf) system
- Improving the Graider profile, application, and acceptance process
- Graider to Assignment matching interface
- Porting remaining pieces of our legacy frontend application to Angular, impelenting testing, and exploring ngrx for state management
- Open sourcing Angular modules and PHP packages that could be useful to the community
- Improving our authentication system and implementing RBAC across our platform
- Help with hiring, onboarding, and training future engineers

## Our requirements

Now that you know a little more about what you'll do and the impact you'll have, here's what you'll need to succeed in this role.

### Baseline technical requirements
- 2+ years working with Javascript/Node as a client or server-side programming language
- 2+ years of experience with another object oriented programming language (PHP preferred)
- 2+ years with HTML and CSS/SCSS/SASS

### Personality Requirements
- You are curious, ask thoughtful questions, and comfortable conducting independent research
- You like to see the big picture and want to know your company's CEO on a first-name basis
- Detail oriented with a desire to do things "the right way" even if you're not quite sure what that way is yet
- Independent learner and do-er who tinkers with things all the time

### Nice to haves
- Experience with [Angular 2+](https://angular.io/) (we're using version 5 currently), and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- Automated testing experience with Karma, Jasmine, or comparable frameworks
- Typescript
- PHP and the Laravel Framework
- Docker
- Webpack
- OAuth flow
- [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) and/or [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform)
- We are a "bring your own device" workplace, but if that is a problem for you, we can figure something out
