## Job Description

As our second software engineer at The Graide Network you'll be involved with the whole development cycle. You will help plan the technical specifications and architecture of new features and changes, you will write high quality, testable code solo and with a pair, you'll spend some time tracking down and squashing bugs, and you will help ensure that we capitalize on new technology opportunities. Learning is part of our culture, so it's okay if you're not a technical expert at everything, but you should be ready and willing to learn quickly.

While you will start out working mostly in our frontend code (Typescript/Angular 5), you'll also need to be okay with doing gradually more backend work over time (Laravel/PHP/MySQL). We do all our local dev in Docker containers, so you'll have to get familiar with that as well.

### The product you'll be working on

Our platform enables teachers to upload assignments and receive high-quality feedback on their students' work from qualified grading assistants who we find and vet. The product's primary workflow is:

- Teachers can upload their assignments with student work attached.
- We find and match their assignment with a Graider (typically college students studying to be teachers).
- The Graider grades the assignment in our platform.
- We return the assignment, student work, and automatically generated reports to the teacher.

### Projects you will likely work on

We're a startup, so things change pretty often, but we've got a long list of interesting projects that our engineering team will be tackling in the coming year. Here are a few of them:

- Automated [grade norming](http://oldwriting.byu.edu/media/documents/org/65.pdf) system
- Improving the Graider profile, application, and acceptance process
- Reworking our Graider to Assignment matching interface and backend algorithm
- Porting remaining pieces of our legacy frontend application to Angular, impelenting tests, and exploring ngrx for state management
- Open sourcing Angular modules and PHP packages that could be useful to the community
- Improving our authentication system and implementing [RBAC](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/role-based-access-control-RBAC) across our platform
- Help with hiring, onboarding, and training future engineers

### Our commitment to diversity

The Graide Network serves a diverse array of students and teachers as customers, and is equally committed to creating a diverse workplace environment. We are a woman-founded business, and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

## Our requirements

### Baseline technical requirements
- 2+ years working with Javascript/Node as a client or server-side programming language
- 2+ years of experience with _another_ object oriented programming language (PHP preferred)
- 2+ years with HTML and CSS/SCSS/SASS

### Personality Requirements
- You are curious, ask thoughtful questions, and are comfortable conducting independent research
- You like to see the big picture and enjoy working with a small, tight knit team
- You're detail-oriented with a desire to do things "the right way" even if you're not quite sure what that way is yet
- You are an independent learner and do-er who tinkers with things all the time

### Nice to haves
- Experience with [Angular](https://angular.io/) (we're using version 5 currently), and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- Automated testing experience with Karma, Jasmine, or comparable frameworks
- Typescript
