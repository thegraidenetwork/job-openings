[The Graide Network](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/) is looking for a proactive, self-driven software engineer who wants to use technology to make an impact on K-12 education.

## Job Description

As our second software engineer you'll be involved with the whole development cycle - not just engineering. You will:

- Gather specifications from the business team at regular product meetings
- Help plan the technical specifications and architecture of new features and changes
- Write high quality, testable code solo and with a pair
- Spend some time tracking down and squashing bugs (we do one bug sprint per month)

Learning is part of our culture, so it's okay if you haven't done everything on this list yet. Just be ready and willing to learn quickly.

### The tech we use

While you will start out working mostly in our frontend code, you'll also work more with our backend over time. We do all our local dev in Docker containers, so you'll get familiar with that as well.

- **Frontend:** Typescript, Angular, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Redis, NGINX
- **Continuous Integration:** Docker, Codeship
- **Production Deployments:** Azure, Ubuntu 18.04, Forge

See our [high level application architecture document for more detail](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1gHQoLr_zEwwn1o-pqSG7DSjPj-as58DbDlGBqVM1G7U/edit?usp=sharing).

### The product you'll be working on

Our platform enables teachers to upload assignments and receive high-quality feedback on their students' work from qualified grading assistants who we find and vet. The product's primary workflow is:

- Teachers can upload their assignments with student work attached.
- We find and match their assignment with a Graider (typically college students studying to be teachers).
- The Graider grades the assignment in our platform.
- We return the assignment, student work, and automatically generated reports to the teacher.

### Projects you will likely work on

We're a startup, so things change pretty often, but here's our 2019 product roadmap as it stands today:

We are a woman-founded business, and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

## Our Requirements

### Passion
- You want to work in education, and make an impact on students and teachers' lives
- Your personal mission and goals align with this role and our company's mission
- You care more about the mission than you do the technology
