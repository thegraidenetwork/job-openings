## Job Description

As a software engineer you'll be involved with the whole development cycle. You will:

- Plan the technical specifications and architecture of new features and changes
- Write high quality, testable code solo and with a pair
- Spend some time tracking down and squashing bugs (we do one bug sprint per month)
- Address security and technical debt as it arises
- Ensure deployments succeed and that production systems stay up

Learning is part of our culture, so it's okay if you haven't done everything on this list yet. Just be ready and willing to learn it.

### The tech we use

While you will probably start out working in the part of our codebase you feel most comfortable with, everyone is a full-stack developer here.

- **Frontend:** Typescript, Angular, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Redis, NGINX
- **Virtualization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Production Deployments:** Azure, Linux, Forge

Here's a diagram of our tech stack to help you visualize how the pieces fit together:

### The product you'll be working on

Our platform enables teachers to upload assignments and receive high-quality feedback on their students' work from qualified grading assistants who we find and vet. The product's primary workflow is:

- Teachers can upload their assignments with student work attached.
- We find and match their assignment with a Graider (typically college students studying to be teachers).
- The Graider grades the assignment in our platform.
- We return the assignment, student work, and automatically generated reports to the teacher.

In 2020, our focus is on developing new reporting and mangement tools for larger schools and districts. You will take an active role in helping develop, test, and release these features with the help of the rest of the team.

### Our commitment to diversity

The Graide Network serves a diverse array of students and teachers as customers, and is equally committed to creating a diverse workplace environment. We are a woman-founded business, and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.
