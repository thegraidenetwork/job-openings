# Our hiring process

We strive to hire the best people while encouraging diversity in our team. With that in mind, our hiring process is a little different (no whiteboarding or high-pressure tests here!) than you might be used to. Here's what to expect when applying for an [engineering job at The Graide Network](https://github.com/thegraidenetwork/job-openings):

## Step 1: Informational Phone Interview

Instead of setting up traditional "phone screenings," Our first call as a two-way [informational interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_interview). You need to know whether or not a place like The Graide Network would be good for you, and we need to know if you've worked with none, some, or all of the same technologies we use. We aren't going to get super-technical on this first call, but if there's something in there work history or resume that stands out, we'll ask about it. This is also a great time to make sure you understand the company and our mission.

## Step 2: In-Person Pairing Project

This is the meat of the interview, and it's much more similar to what we do on a daily basis with our team members in real life. We will pick an open source project with a few issues we can make progress on in 2-3 hours, schedule a time to get together, and then you and an engineer at The Graide Network will [pair program](https://gist.github.com/jordanpoulton/607a8854673d9f22c696) on the issues.

This helps us assess your critical thinking ability (especially when you're the navigator), your communication skills (this is a huge priority for us), the speed at which you pick up new things, and whether or not you might be a good fit for this particular role. Similarly, it allows you to see whether or not you'd like to work alongside us for the next few years. Finally, we'll do more questions and answers if there is anything that you feel like wasn't answered in the first informational session.

## Step 3: Meet the Founders

We're a small startup, so it's important that you know and can work with the company's leadership team, and that you are bought into the mission. We don't believe that every single employee has to be _insanely passionate_ about the business, but we do think that it adds a lot of mileage to early employees. The technical problems we're solving will change often and sometimes they'll be boring, but our mission and core team is likely to be pretty consistent for the next few years.

Behind the scenes, we also do some other vetting (like checking references), but that's pretty much it. If you have questions or concerns about the process, feel free to reach out to [karl@thegraidenetwork.com](mailto:karl@thegraidenetwork.com).
