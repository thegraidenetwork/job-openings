# Paired Programming Project

The [second step of our interview process](https://github.com/thegraidenetwork/job-openings/blob/master/process.md) comprises a paired programming project. Our goal for this project is to assess your critical thinking ability (especially when you're the navigator), your communication skills (this is a huge priority for us), the speed at which you pick up new things, and whether or not you might be a good fit for this particular role.

## Rules
- The candidate with choose 1 or more issues in our [open source rubric creator project](https://github.com/thegraidenetwork/rubric-creator/issues) to work on.
  - Select an issue that we can make progress on, but isn't too easy (we're going to work for around 2 hours).
  - It's okay if we don't complete the issue. The goal is to see how we work together.
- We'll use [Test Driven Development](https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/) as much as possible.
- Weâ€™ll take turns being the [driver or navigator](https://gist.github.com/jordanpoulton/607a8854673d9f22c696), but the candidate will navigate first.
- You should get familiar with the project before coming in.
