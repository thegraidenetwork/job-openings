# Paired Programming Projects

## Rules
- We will mutually pick an open source project using a language both of us know.
- Should be a project that neither of us have done extensive work on before.
- We should work on a reported Github issue that we can make progress on in 2 hours.
- We'll use [Test Driven Development](https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/).
- Weâ€™ll take turns being the [driver or navigator](https://gist.github.com/jordanpoulton/607a8854673d9f22c696), but the candidate will usually navigate first.
- I will choose and send you a link to the project we'll work on at least 24 hours before the interview.

## OSS Projects
